# Zoo Sounds

### Task:
- Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound().

- Create two subclasses: Cat and Cow, each overriding makeSound().

- Create an array of Animal objects (some Cat, some Cow) and iterate through them, calling makeSound().

### Goal:
Practice polymorphism through method overriding and object arrays.
